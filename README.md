# hello-world


HI Humans

Hi How are you ? I am learning Github 

first created a repository 

The Repository name is Hello-World

for every repository there will be a Default Master branch . 

so if we want to make changes to the code , first create one branch from Master , make changes to the code in  that branch ,
and if it is confirmed everything is fine with the code , then commit changes to the branch and raise pull request.
